Dear Music Management Officer,

I am writing to schedule a meeting about the requirements of MusoPlan. <br>If the time works for you, I would like to have a zoom meeting at 03.45 - 04.00 pm on 27/July/2022.<br> Please confirm whether that works for you or if another time is better.

We’ll be discussing<br>
• Data structures for MusoPlan<br>
• Relevant class hierarchies between classes<br>
• Specific conditions and functionality for the program<br>
• Output display of the program.<br>

I look forward to our meeting.

Regards,

Olivia Qiu
Software Programmer, Globex Corporation
