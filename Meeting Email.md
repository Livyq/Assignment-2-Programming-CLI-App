Dear Music Management Officer,

I am writing to schedule a meeting about the requirements of MusoPlan. If the time works for you, I would like to have a zoom meeting at 03.45 - 04.00 pm on 27/July/2022. Please confirm whether that works for you or if another time is better.

We’ll be discussing
• Data structures for MusoPlan
• Relevant class hierarchies between classes
• Specific conditions and functionality for the program
• Output display of the program.

I look forward to our meeting.

Regards,

Olivia Qiu
